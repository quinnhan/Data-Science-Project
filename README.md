# Data Science Project
Data Science is fascinating. I feel the more I practice, the more I have to learn. I also feel that things are intuitive, but the math behind it usually not especially when it comes to statistics and probability. 

Repository consists of all data science practice projects that I have under my belt. I will put my trainer hat on and explain what I understand, what I learn, and how it can be applied to different project. I am a data analyst, I often have to understand the product I am creating and whether it solve the business problem. This also serves as my portfolio for my job search in the future (or now).
