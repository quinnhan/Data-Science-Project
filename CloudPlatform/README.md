I have been learning some cloud technologies (GCP and Azure). I think they revolutionize the data world. I'd like to document projects, issues and troubleshooting, what I found facinating and maybe pros and cons of the two platforms. 
### Account and Pricing 
My GCP learning is through Google Qwiklabs which includes video lessions, labs and access to GCP for practice. Trial period is 30 days then $30 monthly and cancel anytime. For Azure, [learning for data folks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?products=azure&roles=data-analyst%2Cdata-scientist) are free on their [website](www.azure.com), 30 days trial access to Azure Synapse Analytics then pay-as-you-go pricing model. 
### First impression
So much for me to learn. Both platforms are **involved**. Who knew that you could write a ML model and tune parameters in **SQL query** in Google Big Query.

- Dataset: It's free from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanerappeneau/350-000-movies-from-themoviedborg)
